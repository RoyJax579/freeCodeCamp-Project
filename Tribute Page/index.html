            <h1>This timeline of the birth, life and death of Malcolm X:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>May 19, 1925</b>
                    - Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of Earl and Louise Little's seven children. </li>
                <li><b>December, 1926</b>
                    - The Littles leave Omaha and move to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</li>
                <li><b>September 28, 1931</b>
                    - Earl Little is killed in what police term a streetcar accident, but Malcolm later says that the KKK was behind it. After Earl's death, his wife and children struggle to make ends meet and must apply for public assistance.</li>
                <li><b>1939</b> 
                  - The state places the Little children with various foster families, and Malcolm is sent to a juvenile home in the nearly all-white community of Mason, Michigan. He does well at school there, earning straight A's and being elected president of his 8th-grade class, but his teacher discourages him about pursuing his goal of becoming a lawyer.</li>
                <li><b>January, 1946</b>
                   - Malcolm tries to retrieve a stolen $1000 watch from a pawnshop and is arrested and charged with grand larceny, breaking and entering, and firearms possession. He is convicted and, along with Jarvis, receives an eight-to-10-year sentence.</li>
                <li><b>1947</b> 
                  - Malcolm meets a fellow convict he calls "Bimbi," who convinces Malcolm to study and learn to develop his mind. In Jarvis' words, in prison "the only way we knew how to rebel was to cram some knowledge into our brains."</li>
                <li><b>1948</b> 
                  - Malcolm's siblings, four of whom have converted to Islam, introduce him to the words of the Nation of Islam's leader, Elijah Muhammad, who is himself in prison for sedition and violation of the draft laws. The two men correspond, and Malcolm continues his course of study, eventually writing to the Massachusetts governor and demanding the right to practice Islam in prison. He also joins the prison debate team and begins attracting attention for his oratory.</li>
                <li><b>August 7, 1952</b>
                   - Malcolm is released on parole, spends one night with Ella Collins, then goes to Detroit to live with his brother Wilfred. He quickly joins the Nation of Islam and attends meetings at Detroit's Temple No. 1. Malcolm rejects the surname "Little" as a slave name given to his family by white oppressors, and he becomes known as "Malcolm X." Dismayed that the Nation of Islam is not attracting more followers, Malcolm begins an intensive recruiting campaign with Elijah Muhammad's blessing. Soon membership in the Nation begins to soar.</li>
                <li><b>1953</b> 
                   - Having tripled the membership of the Detroit temple in under a year, Malcolm is appointed assistant minister there. Elijah Muhammad then sends Malcolm back to Boston to serve as first minister of its Temple No. 11. He goes on to organize temples along the East Coast, including in Hartford and Philadelphia, attracting new members wherever he speaks.</li>
                <li><b>1956</b> 
                  - Malcolm's future wife Betty Sanders becomes a member of the Harlem Temple and adopts the name "Betty X." They will marry two years later, after Malcolm proposes by phone from a Detroit gas station, and take up residence in East Elmhurst, Queens.</li>
                <li><b>April 14, 1957</b> 
                   - New York Temple member Johnson Hinton is savagely beaten by police. Alerted by other followers, Malcolm joins a contingent of Muslims at the 28th Precinct headquarters in Harlem, where he demands that Hinton receive medical attention. Hinton is eventually taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, but the Muslims refuse to disperse, which alarms police. Satisfied that his demands have been met, Malcolm disperses the crowd with a wave of his hand. He later sues New York City for police brutality and wins the largest settlement in its history. Media coverage of the Hinton incident brings Malcolm national attention, and the FBI, which has kept a file on Malcolm since 1953, now considers him a "key figure" meriting significant surveillance.</li>
                <li><b>1959</b> 
                  - Malcolm makes his first trips abroad, visiting Ghana, Sudan, Nigeria, Iran, Syria, Egypt, and the United Arab Republic; illness prevents him from traveling to Mecca. He meets with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt.<br><br>
                  
                  On July 13, New York television begins airing a five-part documentary by Mike Wallace entitled The Hate that Hate Produced, which Wallace calls "a study of the rise of black racism, of a call for black supremacy among a small but growing segment of the American Negro population." Elijah Muhammad has been against participating in the program, but Malcolm talks him into it. Despite its negative tone, the documentary spurs increased interest and growing membership in the Nation of Islam. In Malcolm's words, "it seems that everywhere I went telephones were ringing." But the Nation's higher profile alarms many in both the white community and the nascent civil rights movement.</li>
                <li><b>March, 1964</b> - Suspended "indefinitely" by the Nation of Islam, Malcolm announces plans to form his own organization called "Muslim Mosque Incorporated." The Nation of Islam responds by requesting, via certified mail, that he surrender all its property, including Malcolm's house in Queens. Malcolm predicts that Black Muslim leaders will murder him because "I know where the bodies are buried." While in Washington to observe a Senate filibuster against the Civil Rights Bill, Malcolm has a chance meeting with Martin Luther King Jr. and a photographer snaps the only picture ever taken of the two men together.</li>
                <li><b>February 21, 1965</b> - Malcolm X is assassinated while speaking at an OAAU rally in Harlem; three members of the Nation of Islam are later convicted despite the fact that the assailant apprehended at the scene Talmadge Hayer insisted that his two co-defendants are innocent.</li>
